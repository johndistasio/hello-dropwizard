# hello-dropwizard

This is a contrived demo project for Dropwizard based on Dropwizard's own [Getting Started](https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.5/docs/getting-started.html) guide with the addition of [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) for dependency injection. HubSpot's [dropwizard-guicier](https://github.com/HubSpot/dropwizard-guicier) library provides the magic here that makes it easy to wire up configuration-driven depdencies.
